Submitted by: Parker Sewell

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Split the bill among a max of 4 users.

## Notes

I was confused for a while how to set a selected index on the segmented control. I had problems with the app icon too. I also found the weird pop-ups for using ‘var’ and not ‘let’ to be confusing. Also - I couldn’t get the tap away to dismiss the keyboard to work because I kept attaching it to the background. I ended up changing that anyway, though! :)
